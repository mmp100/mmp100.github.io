  <h2 id="first" align="justify">Jose Romulo Sosa Ortiz (born 17 February 1948), known by his stage name Jose Jose, is a Mexican singer, musician and occasional actor. Born into a family of musicians, and raised in Mexico City, Jose began his musical career in his early teens playing guitar and singing in serenades. He later joined a jazz and bossa nova trio where he sang and played bass and double bass. Jose found success as a solo artist in the early 1970s. Demonstrating his vocal ability with a stunning performance of the song "El Triste" at a Latin music festival held in Mexico City in 1970, he climbed the Latin charts during that decade. Having achieved recognition as a balladeer, his singing garnered universal critical acclaim from musical peers and media.</h2> 
    <h2 id="tres" align="justify">In the 1980s, after signing with Ariola Records, Jose rose to international prominence as one of the most popular and talented Latin performers. His 1983 album Secretos has sold over 7 million units. With a large number of international hits, he received several Grammy nominations and recognition worldwide. He sold out in venues such as Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall. His music reached non-Spanish-speaking countries like Japan, Israel and Russia.[2] Jose has also forged a career as an actor, starring in movies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavil%C3%A1n_o_Paloma_(film)">Gavilan o Paloma</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perd%C3%B3name_Todo">perdoname todo</a>.</h2>
  <h2 id="cuatro" align="justify">Also known in the entertainment world as El Principe de la Cancion (The Prince of Song), his performance and vocal style have influenced many Latin pop artists in a career that has spanned more than four decades. Because of his vocals and popularity, Jose Jose is considered by Latin audience and media as an icon of Latin pop music and one of the most emblematic Mexican singers of his time.</h2>
       <h1 id="cinco">Early life</h1>
  <h2 id="seis" align="justify">Jose Romulo Sosa Ortiz was born on 17 February 1948 in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City. He was raised in a Roman Catholic family of gifted musicians. His father, Jose Sosa Esquivel, was an operatic tenor (tenor comprimario) and his mother, Margarita Ortiz, was a classical pianist; neither achieved much success. When Jose began to show an interest in singing, they tried to discourage him claiming that it was too difficult to be successful in show business. In 1963, when he was fifteen years old, his mother gave him his first piano. The same year, his reportedly alcoholic father abandoned the family forcing Jose to work to help his mother and younger brother.</h2>
    <h1 id="siete"> early carrer</h1>
  <h2 id="ocho">In his early teens, Jose began his attempts to become a singer. He started his career with serenades. Later, he co-founded a bossa nova and jazz trio called Los PEG, in which he sang and played bass and double bass. The band played at Mexico City's major jazz venues where musicians including Dizzy Gillespie, Erroll Garner, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto used to play.</h2>
    <h2 id="nueve" align="justify">In 1967, looking to launch a solo career, he signed a minor contract to produce two singles under the name "Pepe Sosa". As Pepe Sosa he released the songs "El mundo" (Jimmy Fontana's "Il Mondo") and "Ma Vie" without success. Jose returned to serenades and playing with Los PEG in night clubs. He left Los PEG, and took the artistic name "Jose Jose" in honor of his father, who had recently died of alcoholism. He joined his first name "Jose" with his father's first name - also Jose - from whom he says he inherited his voice. He signed a contract with RCA Victor and recorded his first album: Jose Jose (also known as Cuidado). The album featured songs by Ruben Fuentes and Armando Manzanero. It was arranged by Mario Patron, who was considered the best jazz musician of Mexico, and employed Brazilian percussionist Mayuto Correa, who was in Mexico City playing with bossa nova stars Joao Gilberto, Carlos Lira, Leny Andrade and Tamba Trio. The album's sound is a combination of boleros and romantic ballads with a jazz and bossa nova influence. The quality his debut album garnered praise from critics but it did not achieve much popular success.</h2>
  <h2 id="diez">By the late 1960s his fame increased as he was featured on several TV shows performing his songs live. With songs such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_(Clare_Fischer_composition)">"Morning"</a> and "Cuidado", Jose started to get attention from audiences and the media.</h2>

  <h1 id="doce">The 1970s: "El Triste", consolidation, Ariola Records</h1>
    <h2 id="trece" align="justify">In early 1970 he released the song "La nave del olvido" which became his first big hit in Mexico and Latin America, and recorded his second album: La Nave Del Olvido. Jose's big break came on 25 March 1970, when he represented Mexico in the international song festival the II Festival de la Cancion Latina (Latin Song Festival II, predecessor of the OTI Festival) with a performance of the song "El Triste" which received standing ovations and cheers from Angelica Maria, Alberto Vazquez, Marco Antonio Muniz, and the judges and the spectators in the Teatro Ferrocarrilero in Mexico City. Jose Jose finished in third place which shocked the audience. Thanks to his hit "El Triste", his popular romantic ballad style mixed with a unique voice made him a major star in Mexico. He began his first international tour visiting: Los Angeles, Miami, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Brazil, and Argentina. He played leading roles in such minor films as dream of love and La carrera del millon. Jose performed concerts at the Hollywood Palladium and the Hollywood Bowl.</h2>
      <h2 id="catorce">During the early 1970s, Jose Jose became one of the best known romantic ballad singers in Latin America. He was featured constantly on the most popular Mexican television shows, where he used to sing live with icons of the Hispanic music scene such as Pedro Vargas and Carlos Lico. In 1974, he performed at the Casino Royale & Hotel in Las Vegas. The same year he was invited by Frank Sinatra to record a duet and an album with Reprise Records but this was not possible because of the exclusivity agreement he had with RCA Victor.</h2>
    <h2 id="quince">He had a large number of international hits and toured Latin America several times during the early to mid-1970s. His main hits were: "Del altar a la tumba", "Buscando una sonrisa", "De pueblo en pueblo", "Soy como quieras tu" (Mina's "Sono, come tu mi vuoi"), "Cuando tu me quieras", "Hasta que vuelvas", "Candilejas" (Charles Chaplin's "Terry's Theme"), "Paloma 'every morning that you go'", <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelings_(Morris_Albert_song)">"Sentimientos"</a>, "Vive", "Dejame conocerte" (Paul Anka's "Let Me Get To Know You"), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude_Op._10,_No._3_(Chopin)">"Divina Ilusion"</a> and "Sabras que te quiero". "El Principe" (The Prince) is the song that earned him the nickname El Principe de la cancion (The Prince of Song).</h2>
      <h2 id="dieciseis">In 1977, Jose signed a contract with Ariola Records (today part of Sony BMG) and recorded the album Reencuentro in London. The hit singles "El amar y el querer" and "Gavil√°n o paloma" from Reencuentro increased his popularity. During 1978 and 1979, he achieved enormous success with the albums <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volc%C3%A1n_(album)">volcan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo_Pasado,_Pasado">Lo Pasado, Pasado</a>  and Si Me Dejas Ahora. His main hits from these albums were: "O tu o yo", "Farolero", "volcan", "Lo que un dia fue no sera", "Lo pasado, pasado", "Si me dejas ahora", "Te quiero tal como eres" (written by Billy Joel), and the hit ballad "Almohada".</h2>
