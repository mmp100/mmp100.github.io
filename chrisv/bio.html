	<p>My Opinion on Windows Vs Mac
	<p>Hey guys how are you guys today? My name is Christopher Velez and I’m here to talk about Windows by Microsoft and Mac by Apple and the Pros and Cons between the 2 computers and operating systems. Many people for a lot of years have argued which one is better, which one is less expensive, which one is nicer, which one is faster, which one has more memory. Most people who aren’t very computer orientated usually ask these common questions and more. Let’s start off by talking about that these operating systems are very similar to each other such as the interfaces of the computer, multitasking and using the World Wide Web or even using an email as most people now a days use a computer for. Yes! The end result is the same for any of these operating systems but like many things it will be a different matter getting there such as the red X button on Windows and Mac. On Windows you click the X on the right side to close the program and on Mac you click the X button on the left side to close the windows but the program itself doesn’t close. It is still opened and running even though there no documents or windows running. To close a program completely a user must click on the program name on the top status window (it must be active to do this and then click on Quit or click on apple + Q. You can download either Windows on an apple computer or Mac on a PC which would be considered hackintsoh but you wouldn’t have the best experience on it because it wasn’t originally design to be on it so you would have minor issues with it from my experience. There are also differences in hardware in that Macs are only built by Apple, whereas PCs are built by a number of companies. This reflects in the price, in that Macs are generally more expensive, and the quality of Macs is considered more stable and stylish. But in my opinion I rather just build something stable and stylish to my liking with a PC instead of going by a lame trend on the internet. Although they do have good marketing and a very good audience that advertises there stuff as well I don’t think it’s really worth it. There apple phones sure do beat the windows phones in sales but then there competition would then be the android. But let’s get back to the topic before I sound like that guy from the dummies books. One thing that makes mac a little less of a headache is that it is more secure due to the fact that there are few viruses that can infect Macs. PCs need virus protection and sometimes that’s not enough. Malware exists on Macs, but it’s very rare in comparison to PCs. Macs usually have a straight forward approach to computing with fewer maintenance tasks and focuses more on its user interface making your experience enjoyable. It also works best with apple devices such as IPhone, IPad. Itouch or even an IPod touch if you still have one of those. It can also provide a UNIX like experience and has commercial applications. A Windows PC provides way more flexibility and customization with both hardware and software, it offers support for your hardware to download the software it needs. Windows offers great backwards-compatibility and has an excellent gaming experience if you have the right graphics card and memory for it. I believe Windows beats Mac any day since it is the same platform most of the world uses. I would recommended for PC and gamer users to get that Asus Maximus Hero IX, A 16TB SSD Hard drive, 16GB of RGB Ram and an Intel Core I7 Processor with Windows 10 Pro. For a Mac user I would recommend getting a IMAC or Macbook which everything is already intergrated into the computer and one of the benifits of it is that Apple says it is the "worlds highest resolution display at 5120 x 2880 pixels on a 27-inch screen.</p>
