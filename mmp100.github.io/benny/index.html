			<p>I always wanted to ride a giant mech robot since my childhood days. To join the resistance, to put a stop on President Donald Trump building the wall. Me and my men, WILL do everything in our power to put a holt of his people, and who ever stand on his side, we will fight them to get them out of our way. Im not sure how long the battle will go for, but one thing is for certain, vicory will be at hand.</p>
