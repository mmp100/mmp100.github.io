			<h2 class="title1">About Me</h2>

				<h2>Hello! My Name is Ronny Ruiz. I am 19 years of age, I go to The Borough of Manhattan Community College and my major is Animation and Motion Graphics. I've always loved two things in my life. Video Games and Art. And by Art I mean cartoons and stuff related to that. Luckily for me, my gaming and my art hobby can go hand in hand and I do hope one day I'm one day able to make a great and successful game of my own. I've already got a team learning and willing to help, and I'm gladly able to share some fun little drawings that relate to both of my favorite things.</h2>
