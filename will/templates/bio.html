	<p>My name is William Snyder. I am currently 26 years old and enduring my last semester here at BMCC. I have lived on the east coast my entire life primarily in Maryland, Florida and New York. I have lived in New York City for about four years now and have been engaged to my fiance Ashley for almost a year now after dating for three years. I currently bartend in Brooklyn full time and well as attend school full time. I have almost no free time but hey at least I am investing in myself. When i do have freetime i try to divide my time between nature whether it be hiking or running and playing video games. I love to drink and have a good time with friends. Of course along with drinking comes cooking which i am extremely passionate about. I do have food allergies to gluten and dairy but that just motivates me to cook dishes they boast the same good flavors as the ones i can't ingest. Last but not least, I want to own my own venue one day. Food, beverage and entertainment. It would be a dream to run that venue with my fiance, Ashley.</p>
